# 2022-Halloween-Cyclops-Glasses

Code for my 2022 Halloween costome - Cyclops from X-men

Built using boughten costume Cyclops glasses off Amazon and 3 nOOds from Adafruit, controlled by a KB2040 Adafruit board.

No care has been taken to make this code perfect, change the #defines to consts, remove the unused code (LED colors, was maybe going to use a switch to control modes and use the Neopixel as a mode indicator, but never got around to it.)

This was a quick one night project, code is as is!
